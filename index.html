                    The learnings I took from chapter one is that through emotional intelligence you can learn to control your emotions to better focus yourself and let yourself decide what you want to do with that emotion before it fully arises.

                        A good way to look at what HTML CSS and the DOM is to use the house analogy. HTML can be seen as the structure of the website and is like the different parts of a house. For example a webpage in HTML is split up into different sections, just as a house
                        is split into different rooms, HTML organises these sections.

                        <em>Grid based design</em> is breaking the layout of the page into different boxes. By doing this it is really easy to layout the page and work out what is going to go where and how to do it. A page might not always look like it
                        is sitting on a grid, but if you break it down and draw boxes round the sections, you'll soon see that it is.
