            <p>
              What I learnt from my <em><strong>Mindful Conversation</strong></em> is that when you let the other person talk and don't contribute yourself, you can learn lots about the other person. Usually in conversation you can be quite distracted and stop paying attention to what they are saying, I found since I had to recall what the other person was saying, that I tried to keep a geater attention. The other person liked it, and found it to be a nice bonding thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              To sustain my mindfulness practice, I am going to try the <em>“Do less than you can”</em> method. By limiting myself to doing it for as long as I can without it becoming a burden. I will also try doing it more times a day, at that shorter time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also found the exercise analogy of training yourself to meditate interesting. Getting yourself into a habit/routine to start with and then it eventually becoming less forced, because you now love the benefits from it.
