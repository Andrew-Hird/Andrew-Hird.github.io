              Some of my triggers when programming are usually not having enough faith in myself to complete a task / not bearing with the problem long enough to try and figure it out. This usually lends me to be in a bad mood and want to give up, though I know in the back of my mind that if I stick with the problem I can probably work it out, it's just getting myself out of that mood to be able to do it.

              I found the Siberian North Railroad exercise to be a good way to collect yourself and think about how you ended up in this mood and that it is your body experiencing it and not just your mind. The reflecting and then respond process was good in the sense that you could really evaluate how and why you were feeling like that, and now what is the best way to respond to not only get you out of this mood but also how to address the situation appropriately.
