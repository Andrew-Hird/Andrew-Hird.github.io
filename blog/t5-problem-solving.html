            <h6>July 30th 2016</h6>

            <h5>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h5>
            <p>
                One time I was blocked on a <em>simple problem </em> where my style sheet (styling of the website) was not being applied to the additional pages on my website. The <em>problem solving techniques</em> I used were to try understand at the core why one page was working and why the other one wasn't, in the end I realised that my other pages were in a sub-directory from my index page and had to tell those pages to look one directory back to find the style sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt <em>frustruated</em> to begin with the problem, but as I went on and began to understand the problem more I started to feel good, as I had worked out what the issue was and then was able to rectify it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>What I learnt</em> is that a good way to get to the bottom of a problem is to try and understand why it is not working and then try fix what may be wrong.
            </p>

            <h5>Problem Solved in an Elegant Way</h5>
            <p>
              I had wanted to implement a site wide navigation bar on my website, where all the blog posts would be available in a drop down menu. The problem I faced was my knowledge at the time, where I couldn't quite pull off what I wanted to do without a lot of hassle down the road.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <em>problem solving techniques</em> I used in this case was to ask for advice. I found it not only good to hear someone elses thoughts on the problem but it also became clearer to myself on what I needed to do. I ended up compromising and creating a seperate page for my blog posts where I can just update that page with any new posts rather than having update every page on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt <em>good</em> through out the process as someone had helped me realise what the best decision to make was. What I <em>learned</em> was bouncing ideas off other people is a great way to see if your idea is going to work, as you often come to your own conclusion while speaking aloud.
            </p>

            <h5>Reflect</h5>
            <p>
              I haven't done too much <em>pseudocoding</em> so far as a lot of what I what I need to code isn't to advanced and keep my ideas in my head. Though I can see the value of it and want to make a habit of doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am all about <em>trying something</em>, trial and error is a good process for me as it let's me implement different ways of solving a problem. It can be not so good sometimes as you can be just blindly trying things out and not really thinking about what you are doing and how it is going to affect what you are doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like the idea of the <em>Rubby ducky</em> method as I think explaining a problem aloud to yourself can really help you get to the bottom of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm still finding <em>reading error messages</em> a bit difficult, as I still don't completely understand what the message means!
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven't really used <em>console.loging</em> so much to solve problems, though I can see how it can be good to use, to see what your code is currently doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I <em>google</em> a lot when I get stuck. It is great that if you are facing an issue that someone out there probably also has faced the issue and solution may be available. Though sometimes it can be hard to find specfically what you are after.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have mostly been trying to solve any problems by myself, where I am stuck and want to immediately want to get unstuck! The times I have asked for help from my peers and coaches very good, and in the result have made learn more in depth what is going on and if I was on the right track.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Improving process with reflection</em> is something that I need to work on more, as I don't really debrief with myself once I have completed something.
            </p>

            <h5>What are these Functions?</h5>
            <p>
              <strong>.map()</strong>
              <br>
              <em>.map()</em> calls each element in an array and then constructs a new array from the matching results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>.filter()</strong>
              <br>
              <em>.filter()</em> allows you to call each element in an array and then construct a new array if the statement equals true.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>.reduce()</strong>
              <br>
              <em>.reduce()</em> let's you remove an element from an array.
            </p>
