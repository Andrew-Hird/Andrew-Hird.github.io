              I haven't used any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity, but can see their effectiveness. I want to try wishing everyone I talk to is happy. I know it is easy to get stuck into a frame of mind where you dislike someone, and sometimes not for any particularly good reason. I think by wishing that person is happy when you talk to them can go a long way in to creating a habit about how you feel about them and eventually change the way you feel.

              I liked the empathic listening exercise. I found it was good to be able to talk freely about how you are feeling, while someone is listening, and then have them say it back to you about how you are feeling. By talking aloud I find your feelings towards something really solidify and it helps you work out a situation. I also found it good to listen to someone else, it is easy to get caught in a space where you don't realise other people are struggling with a situation, and being able to help by listening.

              I felt good after the loving kindness meditation, it's nice to be able to do something when you have negative feelings towards someone or a situation, by saying these phrases aloud it really reminds you that the other person is also human, it is easy to forget sometimes that other people have feelings just like you!
