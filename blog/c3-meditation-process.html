            <h3>Mediation Process</h3>
            <h6>July 16th 2016</h6>

            <p>
                The <strong><em>Process over product</em></strong> concept affected me when building my new site as in some instances I had to compromise on how sometihng would look. I didn't want to waste too much time trying to get something to be perfect
                where I had already working version of it. I did lose myself in a couple of rabbit holes when trying to figure something out, it may of taken some time but I did learn more about how css works in the process.
            </p>

            <p>
                My thoughts on meditation prior to reading chapter two of Search Inside Yourself is that it was a way to clear your mind and be peaceful, and to use it to destress. I have used the headspace app a couple of times, and so far I like it and have been left
                feeling good afterwards.
            </p>

            <p>
                New things about meditation that I have learnt is that meditation for your mind is like lifting weights for your muscles. The more you do it, the stronger you become. Also that it rubs off when you are not meditating and can help you concentrate when
                there are distractions around.
            </p>

            <p>
                The suggested technique of acknowledging your breathing stood out to me, as I feel it is something that can be easily done and keeps a good state of mind. Also acknowledging thoughts as they come into your head as you meditate and then being able to let
                them pass by.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been a little slack with remembering to meditate each day, but want to keep doing it, I am to use the headspace app everyday!
