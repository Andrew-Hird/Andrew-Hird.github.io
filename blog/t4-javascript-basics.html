            <h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
              <h6>July 24th 2016</h6>

              <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                <p>
                  Javascript is different to HTML and CSS in the sense that it handles and processes information, where as HTML is the structure of a website and CSS handles the styles. With Javascript you can do more complex things than is possible with just HTML.
                </p>

              <h5>Control Flow and Loops</h5>
                <p>
                  Control flow allows you to dictate how your code will run under different conditions or until certain conditions are met. For example you can use a loop to run a piece of code many times, without having to write it out over and over.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    You can think of brushing your teeth as a control flow loop, where each brush stroke is one action, the loop keeps going or <em>brushing</em> until the condition of <em>clean</em> is met.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Accessing Data From Arrays and Object Literals</h5>
                    <p>
                      To access data from an array you have to use a numerical index  <em>console.log(arr[0]);</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Where in accessing data from an object you use dot notation  <em>console.log(person.name);</em>. The name of the object, a dot, and the name of the property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The difference is that arrays and objects have different syntax, so a different way to access them is needed.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Functions</h5>
                    <p>
                      Functions in Javascript are useful because they allow you to write code that processes information, does calculations or what ever you need it to do, and then be able to call on it later with just its name, saving you from typing it out everything time you need it!
                    </p>
