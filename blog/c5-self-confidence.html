            The Relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is that they are really quite similar. Self awareness is said to be a <em>“neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.”</em> and mindfulness means <em>“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”</em>. As we can see the both really mean to look inside yourself and be aware of what is happening in your body.

              I tried the <em>body scan</em> practice and found it to be very relaxing, not so relaxing that I was falling asleep though! I enjoyed the sensation of just focusing on one part of your body at a time and giving that part of your body your full attention. My initial reaction before trying body scanning was that I thought the time was going to drag on, but I found myself engrossed in the activity and time passing by pretty quickly!

              What I took away from chapter four of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> is that paying attention to what your body is doing and feeling, is really important to having a strong emotional intelligence and providing clarity to your mind so you can be more focus and switched on when you need to be.
