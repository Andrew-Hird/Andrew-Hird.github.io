            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <h6>August 27th 2016</h6>

            <p>
              I've had good experiences with compassionate leadership. When you have a compassionate leader, you feel like they understand you and have your best interest in mind. It motivates you to work harder to please them, as you feel like you are more working as a team rather than individuals. It is a reciprocal type of relationship, that if you both show compassion towards each other and other members in your team, that everyone will win. It also makes for a better workplace to be in, everyone is happy and looking out for one another!

              The <em>multiplying goodness meditation</em> was good, it was nice to breathe in all your own goodness and then have it multiply and then breathe it out, it's hard not to feel happy and good about yourself when doing it. Then breathing in everyone else's goodness was even better, it made me feel empowered and that everyone else was supporting me, and then be able to give back by multiplying it and breathing it out felt really good!

            <p>
              The <em>Tonglen meditation</em> was a bit tougher, at first it was hard to imagine yourself suffering and your initial reaction is wanting to stop and not breathe it in. It felt good transforming it into goodness and then breathing it out into the world. The idea of breathing in other peoples suffering and being able to help them, felt good and made me feel more confident that you are able to make a difference and help people out by helping them process what they are going through.

            <h5>The SCARF Model</h5>
            <p>
              <strong>Status</strong> through phase 0 has been fairly neutral, but also building. I found myself as I am becoming more competent with programming, that the status I give myself is growing as I compare myself now to my former self. I can see this to continue as bootcamp starts, as my learning and competency will continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Certainty</strong> through out phase 0 has been pretty good, as there as been definite goals to work towards and knowing that there is help available if you get stuck. I can potentially see towards the end of bootcamp this certainty might diminish as the certainty of the course is in sight and soon you will be on your own, trying to do it for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Autonomy</strong> has been pretty good through out phase 0, as there is a lot of help available. Being through other members in the cohort experiencing the same thing as you, coaches from EDA so keen to get you unblocked and have you work it out for yourself, and having the whole internet at your disposal to try work out your problem. I think this will continue on the same level as bootcamp commences, but with even more assistance available, as there will be more face time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Relatedness</strong> has been pretty strong through out phase 0. Everyone is friendly and has everyones best interest in mind, it is easy to think of everyone as friends and certainly not foes. I think this will continue to grow as bootcamps comes about, as everybody is on the same path, so it is everybody's best interest too be friendly and help one another out.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fairness</strong> so far has been pretty good through out phase 0. With everyone being very respectful to one another. Similar to relatedness it is in everyones best interest to be fair to one another, as everyone is on the same journey.
