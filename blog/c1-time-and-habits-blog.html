            <h3>Time and Habits</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The timebox and habits techniques I tried were </strong>setting aside time to fufill a task and also using toggl to log how much time I was doing.<br>
              <strong>What I found interesting was </strong> when I set aside the time I really felt like it was work time and focussed quite hard on what I was doing.<br>
              <strong>What worked for me was </strong> using toggl to put me in the work state of mind and having the time set aside to achieve what I wanted to achieve.<br>
              <strong>I think I will experiment with further </strong> the idea of having a limited amount of time to get a task done, to motivate myself to do it and breaking that task about into smaller tasks to be more focus, and then taking regular breaks through to get my mind fresh.
