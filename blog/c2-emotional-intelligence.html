            The learnings I took from chapter one is that through emotional intelligence you can learn to control your emotions to better focus yourself and let yourself decide what you want to do with that emotion before it fully arises. I thought it was interesting when he talked about how your body senses these oncoming emotions before your mind does, either through body actions or a gut feeling. It's interesting to note that by having emotional intelligence that it'll not only make you more happy and focused, but will also rub off with other people you are working with.

            I liked the <em>two minutes of mindfulness</em>, I had done some meditation the week before and had the same feelings. The feeling of being calm during and after is really good for either preparing yourself to focus or unwinding your mind before a rest. I thought the two minutes would feel a lot longer, but they went by fairly quickly!
