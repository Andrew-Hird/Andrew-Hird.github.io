            <p>
              In Javascript there is two types of scope, local and global, and refers to where you can access different elements of your code.
            </p>
            <p>
              You're in global scope before you write any code, global scope variables can be accessed be accessed by any function in your javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Local scope is the scope within functions and can only be accessed within that function. If you try and access a local scope variable out of the local scope, javascript will come up with undefined as that variable does not exist in global scope. When you create a new function you create a new scope, you can also create functions inside functions giving you another layer of local scope.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can think of global and local scope like how a city like Auckland (local scope) has rules and laws but also abides by the rules and laws of New Zealand (global scope). The rules and laws of Auckland are unique to Auckland and don't necessarily apply to other cities in the country, other cities will have their own rules and laws but also abide the rules and laws of New Zealand.
