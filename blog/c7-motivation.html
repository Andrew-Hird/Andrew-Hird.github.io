            <p>
              What I think life looks like through the <em>'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens</em> is that life looks good! It is just finding a place and a way to get to the places of happiness, I think this can be achieved by trying to do something you love and putting yourself in the right place for it to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the <em>'discovering values and higher purpose'</em> exercise I found that my core values are ones of trying to please, not let down other people and that I find it hard to say no to people. I think what I stand for is trying to do my best, trying not to let other people down and helping people out if they ask for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found the <em>resilience ideas and meditation exercise</em> to be good, as it is important to remind yourself that everyone does struggle and fail in life and it doesn't mean that you won't succeed, it was nice to think about when you succeeded after dwelling on the failure, and that even the best and smartest people feel like that they are stupid sometimes and it is just matter of training yourself to be more optimistic to help you go forward.
